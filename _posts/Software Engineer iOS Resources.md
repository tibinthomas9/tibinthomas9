## End Notes

Develop a guide for iOS which details out important structured details of iOS development which details most important things to learn like concurrency but also discuss minute non technical details like signing, app Ids,Apples recoomended way, which frameworks use target action pattern, which use singletons, which use delegates ,which use functional programming, protocol programming, event driven or reactive programing(swiftUI, combine, Rxswift), concection between functional and reactive, declarative programming, key value coding and Obeserving. Various values in plist, which functionalities need an associated permission text in plist etc, when to use swift, swiftUI, ObjectiveC, when to use GCD vs Operations vs Threads, where to use value driven programing or reference types, how threads are handled in multi cores, how data gets saved during context switch, importance of ABI stability of swift, how swift, objectivec and C work together in the OS, details about POSIX features, learn from transistor, how SoliD patterns get enforced via protocol oriented programming, how design patterns and different programing patterns work together in swift or Cocoa

 Notes

If you're an iOS engineer looking to prep, save your $75 and do the following instead:

- Read and code along with iOS-Unit-Testing-Example by Jon Reid
- Watch and absorb the content by Essential Developer Academy by Caio & Mike on their Youtube channel. Their free content is fantastic.
- For system design, you can't go wrong with the Mobile System Design repo. I'll add a link in the comments.
- Design shit. Build shit and ask people to review your shit. Hit me up and I'll check it out. No, really. Go look for a free API, pull data down, and display it. Do it in UIKit. Do it in SwiftUI. Build an app that uses websockets. Build an app that uses pagination. Build an app that supports offline shit. Build an app that uses MVVM. Build an app that uses VIPER. Build an app that uses the stack that your target company uses. BUILD SOME DAMN APPS.
- 

 🤓 Here's some handy Swift code for calling Objective-C methods with more than two arguments.

Normally, NSObject's perform(_:with:with:) method is enough, but there's a two argument limit which I often hit. Just replace `welcomeController` with your NSObject.

Using small static libraries instead of a single module can offer several benefits in iOS app development, especially for larger projects:

1. Faster build times: ---- When working with a large project, building the entire codebase can be time-consuming. By using small static libraries, you can build and link only the components that have changed, reducing build times significantly. This allows for faster iterations during development and improves developer productivity.

2. Parallel development: ---- Splitting the codebase into small static libraries enables parallel development by different teams or developers. Each team can work on their specific library without interfering with others. This parallelization can accelerate development timelines and enhance collaboration.

3. Code encapsulation and reusability: ---- Static libraries promote encapsulation of specific functionalities or modules into separate units. These units can be easily reused across multiple projects, reducing code duplication and increasing efficiency. Encapsulation also makes it easier to maintain and update specific parts of the codebase without affecting other components.

4. Granular control over dependencies: ---- With small static libraries, you have more control over managing dependencies. Each library can have its own set of dependencies, and you can manage them independently. This can help prevent dependency conflicts and simplify the management of third-party libraries.

5. Incremental updates and releases: --- When using small static libraries, it becomes easier to deliver updates and bug fixes to specific components without affecting the entire application. This granularity allows for faster deployment of critical fixes and reduces the risk of introducing new bugs during the release process.

6. Better code organization and maintainability: --- Splitting the codebase into small static libraries helps maintain a clean and organized project structure. Each library focuses on a specific functionality or feature, making it easier to understand, modify, and maintain the codebase over time.

7. Improved recompilation times: --- If a specific static library undergoes changes, only that library needs to be recompiled. This saves time during the build process and speeds up the overall development workflow.

However, it's important to strike a balance between creating too many small static libraries and having too few large ones. Overcompartmentalization can introduce unnecessary complexity and increase build times due to excessive linking. It's crucial to find the right balance based on the specific needs and complexity of your project.



ioS lead essentials

Module 1 - Planning and System Design: The fundamentals of good system design and architecture. You'll learn how to think, design, and draw diagrams like a software architect. The goal is for you to start on the right foot, forming a solid foundation where you can stack the upcoming knowledge.

Module 2 - Networking: You'll code following networking best practices and learn how to develop, maintain, and test a clean networking layer in your iOS apps with key frameworks such as URLSession, URLProtocol, Decodable, and third-party code. You'll also learn how to work effectively with backend teams.

Module 3 - Persistence: You'll code and learn step-by-step how to effectively tackle challenges when it comes to developing, maintaining, and testing a clean persistence layer in your iOS apps using URLCache, CoreData, FileManager, Codable, and other key persistence frameworks.

Module 4 - UI and Presentation: UI, UX, and Presentation best practices, and how to develop, maintain, and test a clean UI and Presentation layer in your iOS applications. You'll code and learn how to use MVC, MVVM, MVP, and their variants, prototyping techniques, localizing your apps, working effectively with designers, and how to create reusable UI/Presentation components.

Module 5 - Main Composition: Learn how to compose modules to form a fully functional app, including app navigation and custom flows. You'll also learn how to validate high-level acceptance criteria with automated tests at every level (Unit, Integration, Snapshot, and UI tests). You'll code following best practices, including how to use the Combine framework and how to develop, maintain, and test-drive a clean Composition layer in your iOS applications.

Module 6 - Navigation and Advanced Patterns Module: Learn how to develop better apps faster with ready solutions to common challenges such as pagination with caching, navigation, dependency injection, generic and reusable components, performance optimizations, logging, profiling, and modularization in large apps.

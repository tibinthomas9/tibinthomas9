# Why use protocols in swift

## To provide abstraction
  To generalize common behaviour or data out into an abstract structure which enables reusability of code as well as maintainability 
  in a safe manner(as swift ensures type conformance at compile time)

## To share implementations which are abstract behaviours

      Use structures along with protocols to adopt behaviour by sharing implementations.

## which in turn helps to enforce the SOLID principle and cleaner code

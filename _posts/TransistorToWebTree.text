Computer architecture is the design and organization of a computer system, starting from its fundamental building blocks - transistors. Transistors are tiny electronic switches that can be used to build digital circuits, which are the foundation of modern computers. By combining these circuits, we can create logic gates that can perform basic operations, such as addition and subtraction.

Using these gates, we can then build more complex circuits, like flip-flops and registers, that can store and manipulate data. We can also build more advanced circuits, like processors, which can execute instructions and perform complex calculations. Processors use a combination of registers, arithmetic logic units (ALUs), and control units to perform their operations.

To make these processors more useful, we can add memory to store instructions and data, and input/output devices to interact with the outside world. With these components, we can build embedded systems, which are computers built into other devices, like cars or appliances.

To program these systems, we use high-level languages like C, which can be compiled into machine code that the processor can execute. Operating systems provide a layer of abstraction between the hardware and the user, allowing multiple programs to run at the same time and managing resources like memory and CPU time.

With the advent of networking, we can connect these systems together to form networks, and use protocols like TCP/IP to enable communication between them. And finally, we can build web applications that run on top of these networks, using web browsers to access content and services hosted on remote servers.

Overall, computer architecture is a constantly evolving field, with new technologies and applications emerging all the time. But at its core, it is the art of designing and building systems that can process and manipulate information, and provide useful services to users.

1.  Transistors: The foundation of modern computing begins with the invention of the transistor, a semiconductor device that can amplify and switch electronic signals. Transistors form the building blocks of modern microprocessors, which are the heart of modern computers.
    
2.  Digital Logic and Binary Number Systems: Digital logic is the foundation of modern computing. It uses Boolean algebra and logic gates to represent and manipulate digital signals. Binary number systems are used to represent digital data in a computer.
    
3.  Computer Architecture: Computer architecture refers to the design of the hardware components that make up a computer system. This includes the central processing unit (CPU), memory, input/output devices, and other peripheral devices.
    
4.  Von Neumann Architecture: The von Neumann architecture is a model of computer architecture that was proposed by John von Neumann in the 1940s. It describes the basic organization of a computer system, which includes a central processing unit (CPU), memory, and input/output devices. The von Neumann architecture is still used in most modern computers.
    
5.  Machine Language and Assembly Language: Machine language is the lowest-level programming language that a computer can understand. It consists of a series of binary instructions that the CPU can execute directly. Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is easier to read and write than machine language. It uses mnemonic codes to represent the binary instructions of machine language.
    
6.  Digital Design: Digital design is the process of designing digital circuits using hardware description languages (HDLs). It involves the use of combinational and sequential logic, finite state machines, and other digital design techniques.
    
7.  Microcontrollers and Embedded Systems: Microcontrollers are small, self-contained computer systems that are used in a wide range of embedded applications. They typically include a CPU, memory, and input/output peripherals. Programming in C for microcontrollers involves working with peripherals, interrupts, and communication protocols.
    
8.  Compilers: A “high” level language: A compiler is a software tool that translates high-level programming languages into machine code that a computer can execute. Building a C compiler involves writing a parser, building a linker, and implementing library functions.
    
9.  Operating Systems: Software we take for granted: An operating system (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs. Building an operating system involves designing and implementing memory management, process management, and file systems.
    
10.  Browser: Coming online: A web browser is a software application that enables users to access and navigate the World Wide Web. Building a web browser involves implementing a TCP/IP stack, creating a user interface, and implementing dynamic linking.
    
11.  Web Applications: Web applications are software programs that run on web servers and can be accessed using a web browser. They are written using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and can communicate with web servers using HTTP or other web protocols.
    

Overall, understanding computer architecture from transistor to web requires knowledge of digital logic, computer organization, software engineering, and web development. It is a fascinating and ever-evolving field that has revolutionized the way we live and work.

Section 1: Intro: Cheating our way past the transistor -- 0.5 weeks

So about those transistors -- Course overview. The course will begin by exploring how FPGAs are built using transistors, and how integrated circuits (ICs) are just collections of transistors in a reliable package. Understanding the basics of transistors and ICs is essential for understanding digital electronics and computer science.

The first part of this section involves coding an assembler in Python. This is a straightforward and relatively simple task that involves writing a program that can convert assembly language code into machine code that the processor can execute. The emphasis here is on learning ARM assembly language and understanding how assembly language programs are translated into machine code.

The second part of this section is where the real fun begins. Students will build an ARM7 CPU using Verilog, breaking the project down into subchapters that cover the various components of the CPU, such as the fetch and decode units, the execution unit, and the pipeline. One of the key challenges here is figuring out how much BRAM (block RAM) will be needed to store the CPU's program and data memory. Students will need at least 1MB of memory to work with, and DDR (double data rate) memory may be too difficult to implement, so SRAM (static RAM) is a good choice.

Section 6: Browser: Coming online -- 1 week

Building a Simple Web Browser with TCP stack and Dynamic Linking

In this chapter, we will explore the world of web browsing by building a simple text-based web browser using ANSI and terminal niceness. The browser will be built on top of a TCP stack that we will develop in C, and we will also implement space-saving dynamic linking to make the browser more efficient.

Section 6: Browser: Coming online -- 1 week

Building a TCP stack (C, 500)

We will start by building a simple TCP stack in C. We will integrate the Ethernet driver into the kernel and add support for networking syscalls to the kernel (send, recv, bind, connect). This will allow us to establish TCP connections with other devices on the network and communicate with them.

To build the TCP stack, we will need to understand the TCP protocol and its various components such as sequence numbers, acknowledgement numbers, and window sizes. We will also need to implement the three-way handshake for establishing a TCP connection and handle various TCP flags like SYN, ACK, and FIN.

Once we have built the TCP stack, we can move on to the next step of building a telnet server.

telnetd, the power of being multiprocess (C, 50)

We will build a simple telnet server in C that will allow users to connect to our device remotely via the telnet protocol. The telnet server will be a bind shell, allowing users to execute commands on our device remotely.

We will make the telnet server multiprocess so that it can handle multiple connections simultaneously. This will involve creating child processes to handle each incoming connection.

Space saving dynamic linking (C, 300)

Next, we will implement space-saving dynamic linking to make our browser more efficient. Dynamic linking is the process of linking a program to shared libraries at runtime rather than at compile time. This allows multiple programs to share the same library code, saving space.

We will explore how the dynamic linker is just a user space program, and we will make changes to the linker required for our browser.

So about that web (C, 500+)

Finally, we will build our simple text-based web browser using ANSI and terminal niceness. We will dynamically link the browser to the required libraries, and we will implement features such as parsing HTML, displaying images, and navigating links.

We will also explore how modern web browsers work and how they are built on top of more advanced networking protocols like HTTPS and TLS.

By the end of this chapter, you will have built a simple but functional web browser from scratch, and you will have a better understanding of how networking protocols and dynamic linking work.
